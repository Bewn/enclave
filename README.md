# enclave
### work in progress. Basic function confirmed. full UI and features coming.
a short shell-based cli for using linux unified key system, kernel logical volume management, and virtual loop devices to make a randomized file into a disk image for a virtual filesystem that you can mount anywhere.

Essentially like encrypted usb sticks, but with virtual devices and accessible anywhere.

Useful for storing any file privately and securely without the use of passwords (must keep your key files safe! (perhaps with a master password))
